This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to removing an element that may not exist on the page. The bug occurs in the JavaScript code where it attempts to remove the element with the ID 'myDiv'. If the element is not found, this will cause an error. The solution is to first check if the element exists before attempting to remove it.
